   <p style="text-align:center">Physician Directed Treatment-in-Place Ambulance Services (LAC 50:IX.Chapter 13)</p> 
   <p style="text-align:justify">The Department of Health, Bureau of Health Services Financing adopts LAC 50:IX.Chapter 13 in the Medical Assistance Program as authorized by R.S. 36:254 and pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act. This Emergency Rule is promulgated in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, R.S. 49:962, and shall be in effect for the maximum period allowed under the Act or until adoption of the final Rule, whichever occurs first.</p> 
   <p style="text-align:justify">The Department of Health, Bureau of Health Services Financing promulgated Emergency Rules which allowed reimbursement throughout the duration of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency for ambulance services provided on site without transport, within established treatment protocols, and under the direct supervision of a licensed physician <i>(Louisiana Register, </i>Volume 46, Number 7 and Volume 47, Number 11). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) waived requirements in order to expand the types of health care professionals eligible to bill for telehealth services provided from a distant site. As a result of the CMS waiver, the department now adopts provisions in the Professional Services Program to continue to provide reimbursement for physician directed treatment-in-place ambulance services after the COVID-19 public health emergency ends on May 11, 2023.</p> 
   <p style="text-align:justify">This action is being taken to promote the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries by ensuring that these services continue to be provided. It is anticipated that implementation of this Emergency Rule will have no fiscal impact for state fiscal year 2022-2023.</p> 
   <p style="text-align:justify">Effective May 12, 2023, the Department of Health, Bureau of Health Services Financing adopts provisions in the Professional Services Program to provide reimbursement for physician directed treatment-in-place ambulance services.</p>
